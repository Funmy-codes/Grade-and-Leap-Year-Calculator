This repository contains two simple Python programs demonstrating the use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) to perform basic calculations.

### 1. Grade Calculator
The Grade Calculator program allows users to input their grade, and it outputs a corresponding letter grade based on the provided range:

- *F*: 0-40
- *P (Pass)*: 41-50
- *C (Credit)*: 51-70
- *A (Excellent)*: 71-100

This program is a good introduction to basic decision-making in Python using conditional logic.

### 2. Leap Year Calculator
The Leap Year Calculator checks whether a given year is a leap year based on these conditions:

- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400.
- A year divisible by 100 but not 400 is *not* a leap year.
- A year divisible by 4 but not 100 is a leap year.
- All other years are not leap years.

This program demonstrates how logical operators can be combined with conditionals to solve real-world problems.
